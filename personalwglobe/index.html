                    Hi! My name is Erik Vargas and I am a full stack 
                    developer with strengths in JavaScript and Python. 
                    I am an inventor at heart and I possess an insatiable 
                    drive to bring my ideas and designs to life.

                    <h4> Education: </h4>
                    <p id="edu">
                        I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania 
                        in 2020 with a degree in Physics of Cum Laude 
                        distinction. While I did not take a single computer 
                        science course while there, the rigor of the classes 
                        I took, the problem-solving approaches I learned, 
                        and the metacognitive abilities I gained prepared me 
                        to readily learn anything I put my mind to, including 
                        full stack development.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div id="experience">
                    <h4> Experience: </h4>
                    <p id="exp">
                        After graduating, I decided to take on jobs that pushed 
                        me to learn about the world around me - I found my self 
                        serving, bartending, and then later teaching high school 
                        physics. Through these experiences I learned a lot about 
                        workflows, working backwards to bring a project to fruition, 
                        managing stressful situtations effortlessly, working with 
                        and managing other people, among many other lessons. 
                        <br> 
                        I also taught myself software development out of interest to solve 
                        problems around me, and to figure out how the systems 
                        that govern our modern world work. I crafted and worked 
                        dilegently on my own curriculum, from Harvard CS50 to 
                        the Odin Project, and I have been eager to keep up with the 
                        industry's latest developments. I cannot wait to see what the
                        future holds!
